1) The problem.

Writing directions is usually harder than following them, even with talented engineers.
Furthermore, communication skills are not enough emphasized in a technical education whereas good and clear guidance are critical for optimal team work.


2) A description of the end result. 

Ultimately, we expect a step-by-step guidelines process to provide us with a clear way to get things done, document steps to ourselves
and to the team and eventually clients so that the whole action plan can be replicated as needed in a standard way, with or without us in the loop.

3) The solution detailed in a step-by-step manner.





Proceed by the following set of instructions:
1. Take a slice of bread;
2. Put peanut butter on the slice;
3. Take a second slice of bread;
4. Put jelly on that slice.
5. Press the slices of bread together.


1. Wash hands with soap;
2. Get supplies;
3. Get a plate;
4. Take the bread from the supplies;
5. Place it on the plate.
6. If bread in slices, Place 1st slice of bread on plate;
6.1. Else, cut a slice of bread. Place 1st slice of bread on plate;
7. Open the jar of peanut butter by twisting the lid counter clockwise;
8. Pick up a knife from the supplies, holding it by the handle;
9. Insert the knife into the jar of peanut butter.
10. Scoop a fair amount of peanut butter with it;
11. Spread peanut butter on bread as needed;
12. Get another plate;
13. Take a second slice of bread;
14. Repeat steps 5-11 with the second slice of bread and the jar of jelly instead of peanut butter.
15. Press the two slices of bread together.
16. Check that both the peanut butter and the jelly meet.

If you want, and have time, make some more for friends and family by repeating steps 5 to 11 for both peanut butter and jelly.
